      My name is Mark Grisez, and I serve as principal trumpet of the Columbus
      Symphony Orchestra. I also explore what it means "[to
      music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Small#Musicking)" on The
      Curious Musician. I’ve played for Darth Vader on the escalators of San
      Diego Comic Con. I've told stories about robots and rocketships onstage at
      the New World Center. I'm probably best known for a video I made about the
      finer points of “horse whinnying” on the trumpet.
